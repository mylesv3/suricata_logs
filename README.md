# Scenario
In this scenario, you're a security analyst who must monitor traffic on your employer's network. You'll be required to configure Suricata and use it to trigger alerts.

Here's how you'll do this task: First, you'll explore custom rules in Suricata. Second, you'll run Suricata with a custom rule in order to trigger it, and examine the output logs in the `fast.log` file. Finally, you'll examine the additional output that Suricata generates in the standard `eve.json` log file.

For the purposes of the tests you'll run in this lab activity, you've been supplied with a `sample.pcap` file and a `custom.rules` file. These reside in your home folder.
# What I Learned
-   create custom rules and run them in Suricata,
-   monitor traffic captured in a packet capture file, and
-   examine the `fast.log` and `eve.json` output.
# Technology Used
- Bash
- Suricata
